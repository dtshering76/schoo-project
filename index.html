          and inaugurated by Mr.Jitender Kumar Sharma, Consul General, Consulate
          of India, Phuentsholing on 16th May, 2014. Locally, it is called
          Dhamdara, however the present name of a school was given by His
          Holiness Trulku Jigme Choeda, 70th Jey Khenpo of Bhutan. It is
          beautifully located on a gentle slope overlooking Phuntsholing town.
          It shares boundary with Phuntsholing General Hospital towards the
          North and Food Cooperation of Bhutan towards South-West. It is
          situated approximately 1 km away from the gate way of Bhutan,
